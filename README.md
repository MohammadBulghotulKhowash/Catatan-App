# <em>Catatan</em> App - React Native

A simple <strong><em>Catatan</em></strong> application built with React Native. This app allows users to create tasks, view the tasks, and delete them.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add tasks with a title and description.
- **View Tasks**: Display a list of added tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved using AsyncStorage, so they persist even when the app is closed.

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. Code Quality: The code is still a work in progress and has not yet been fully cleaned up. Some parts may lack proper optimization, structure, or comments. This is a known limitation, and improvements will be made in future versions.

2. Error Handling: Error handling is minimal, and the app may not handle all edge cases properly.
